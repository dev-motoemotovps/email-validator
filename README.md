# email-validator

Here is probably one of the best programs that I'm going to make for a long while. It is a web app that will allow you to validate emails, it can be your emails or whatever, using a publicly available free API. This program is written in Python and it uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to handle the functions for the website.

The only third-party library that you need to install on Python to run this is Flask. To get your own API key for this API to validate the emails, you can get it at https://apilayer.com/marketplace/email_verification-api. Just sign up for an account and you can get your API.

You should show the developers some support though because they are allowing you to use their API for free for up to 100 requests. I think it's pretty generous, especially since this API is damn accurate for validating emails. Once you get your API key, just put it in the Python file. It's hard-coded because I'm lazy and this is program is not designed for a production environment.

I made this in like 2 hours, so that's probably the main reason. Anyways, hope you enjoy! Oh, just for a side note, I didn't add any comments in the code. Lazy, I guess, but I guess if you use any other programs that I wrote, you should know that I don't tend to ever add comments. Bad habit, I know, and I probably will not be adding any updates to this program in the near future. Hope you enjoy it! It will be the last program I'm making for many months to come, but the next program that I end up making I think will be really good. So, just for clarification, that's what I'm going to be doing for the next couple of months. Anyways, bye!
